### How to work & develop the package?

#### Preprocessors

There is parent class Preprocessor from which developer needs to inherit for a new subclass. Methods should be called according to functionality of subclass.

#### Feature Generatos

There is parent meta class Transformer from which developer needs to inherit for a new subclass. There is uniform method of generate that developer should create with functionality that subclass represents.

#### Models

There is Model class which serves as a wrapper around scikit-learn models. Currently Logistic Regression and Random Forest algorithm is supported. There are 3 methods: train, predict and predict proba. Train stands for training data, predict responsible for returning prediction as classes i.e. 1/0, predict proba returns probailities for each class.

#### Evaluation

There is Metric class with variious methods for each metrics. To develop new one developer should create relevant function add it to calculate_score method's score_dict object with key and value as reference pointer to the function. Also must specify in if else part whether it uses preicted probabilities or class to calculate metric.
